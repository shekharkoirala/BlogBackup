Imagine a box where you put all of your machine learning stuff, Here it is.
[WIP] will update the structure 

### Bias vs Varience

### Metrics

#### Precision

#### Recall

#### Accuracy

#### F1-score

### Cross-Validation
How do you choose which cross validation technique will be used for your project. 
THink about how your model will be sued and interact with the data in a deployed setting. 
if the dataset is huge, use Hold-out, which is basically 80-20 method

#### K fold
if the data points are independent to each other. 

if the dataset is unbalanced: stratifiedKfold, as it should be aware with the classes.
if very little data, shufflesplit


#### Time split
if time is influencial in generation of the data, use Timesplit

#### GroupKfold
if the data is generated by the a patient , and we have lets say n patient generating the x data point,
it would be great to use group kfold. Group in this case in the participants. 

#### stratified Groupkfold
if the data points skewed, we can use the stratisfied GroupKfold as well.
